                <p>Welcome to our project inspired by Lazada Group!</p>
                <p>This project is a result of our collaborative effort to explore the world of eCommerce within the context of a university assignment. Our team of four is passionate about learning and innovation, and we've come together to create something special.</p>
                <p>In this report, we'll share our journey, insights, and the technical aspects of our project. We hope you enjoy learning about our work as much as we enjoyed creating it.</p>
